# Git Demo repository

This is a very basic repository to demonstrate some basic functionality within git.

Adding some basic changes to the readme...

## Remotes

[Git is a "distributed version control system" (DVCS)][git-dvcs], which means that you can have multiple remote hosts registered to your local clone. In fact, your local clone can be used as someone else's remote - this was how Git was meant to be used!
