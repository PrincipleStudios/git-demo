# Git Tools Demo repository

This repository is designed to be a testing ground for various git tooling using the scaled git branching strategy. Branches will be tagged and reset periodically for testing purposes.

## This branch

This branch is intended to represent an out-of-date feature that should be able to be merged cleanly with its upstream, but it hasn't been updated. This should fail PR checks, but otherwise be able to merge successfully.

## Remotes

[Git is a "distributed version control system" (DVCS)][git-dvcs], which means that you can have multiple remote hosts registered to your local clone. In fact, your local clone can be used as someone else's remote - this was how Git was meant to be used!
