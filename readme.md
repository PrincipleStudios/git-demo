# Git Tools Demo repository

This repository is designed to be a testing ground for various git tooling using the scaled git branching strategy. Branches will be tagged and reset periodically for testing purposes.

## Reset branch

This branch is designed to hold workflows to reset the project to expected states. It does not share a history with the rest of the repository.
